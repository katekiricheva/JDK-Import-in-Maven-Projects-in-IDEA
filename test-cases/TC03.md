# Test Case TC03 – Java version via `<plugin>` `<source>` and `<target>`

## Description
To verify that IntelliJ IDEA correctly imports the Java language level when the version is set via `<plugin>` `<source>` and `<target>` in the `pom.xml`.

## Prerequisites
1. Single-module Maven project is freshly imported and opened in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. No additional configuration affects the Java version defined in the `pom.xml`.

## Steps
1. Open the `pom.xml` file.
2. Verify that the Java version is correctly defined in the `<plugin>` `<source>` and `<target>` sections.
3. Navigate to: File → Project Structure → Project.
4. Check the "SDK" and "Language level" values.
5. Navigate to: File → Project Structure → Modules → Dependencies.
8. Verify the "Module SDK" settings.
6. Navigate to: File → Project Structure → Modules → Sources.
7. Check the "Language level" settings.

## Expected result
1. Project SDK matches the Java version specified in the `pom.xml`.
2.  Module SDK is set to “Project SDK” with the Java version specified in the `pom.xml`.
3. Project language level matches the Java version specified in the `pom.xml` (not set to "SDK default").
4. Module language level matches the Java version specified in the `pom.xml` (not set to "Project default").
